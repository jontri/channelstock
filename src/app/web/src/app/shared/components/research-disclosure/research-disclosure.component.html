              <span>
                      The fundamental assessment rating system is designed to provide insights on the company's fundamentals both on a macro level, which incorporates a company's market opportunity and competitive position, and on a micro/company specific level. The micro/company specific attributes include operating &amp; financial leverage, and corporate governance/management. The number of check marks that a company receives is designed to provide a quick reference and easy determination of the company's fundamentals based upon the following five attributes of the company (weighting reflects the importance of each attribute in the overall scoring of company’s fundamental analysis):

              While these are the attributes currently used for the analyst's fundamental analysis, the attributes and weighting may be reviewed, updated with additional attributes, and/or changed in the future based on discussions with the analysts and recommendations from the Director of Research.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
                  Following is the description of each attribute in the fundamental analysis.
          </span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Corporate Governance/Management</b><br/>
            <span>
                    We believe that a review of corporate governance and assessment of the senior management are important tools to determine investment merit. Good corporate governance aligns management with the interests of stakeholders. As such, analysts are to rank the company on the basis of good corporate governance principles that may include rules and procedures, board composition and staggered term limits, rights and responsibilities, corporate objectives, monitoring of actions and policies, and accountability. In addition, analysts will assess issues with controlling shareholders and whether decisions have been made in the past that were in the interests of all shareholders. In addition, management will be assessed based on industry experience, expertise, and/or track record.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>
                    High ranking example: Board and management that is aligned with the interests of shareholders with incentives based on stock price appreciation and with an experienced management team known for exceptional shareholder returns.<br>
                    Low ranking example: Concentrated ownership without independent directors that do not necessarily align with all shareholders' interests.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>The Market Opportunity Analysis</b><br>
          <span>
                  In this review, the analyst assesses the company's macro environment as a measure of understanding the industry. Factors considered include the size and growth potential of the industry under various economic conditions, the emerging demands in the market, technological benefits/disruptions, competition, geographical opportunities, and customer demands/needs, and an assessment of supply and distribution channels. In addition, the analyst will review legal and regulatory trends, as well as potential shifts in consumer or social behavior and natural environment changes.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
                  High rank example: A company in an industry that is growing revenues well above GDP rates (which are on average 2% plus) and/or may have unmet or under-served needs in a rapidly growing market opportunity. <br>
                  Low rank example: A mature industry that is in secular decline and likely to grow below GDP rates.
          </span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Competitive Position</b><br/>
            The evaluation of the company's competitive position is another macro environment attribute designed to measure
            the relevance, market share, position and value proposition, and sustainable differentiations of the company and
            its products/services within its industry. Ease of entry into the industry and the ability of other well-funded
            players to potentially enter the market would be determined. As such, the assessment would consider the
            company's
            strengths and advantages of its products/services against weaknesses and limitations. This may include the
            company's current brand awareness, pricing and cost structure, current market strategies and geographic
            penetration that may affect demand for its products/services. In addition, the company's competitors would be
            evaluated.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>
                    High rank example: An analyst would consider the company's product to be superior to its competitors and that should allow the company to gain market share.<br>
                    Low rank example: A company with a "me-too" product that does not have any significant technology advantages in an industry that has low barriers to entry.
            </span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Operating Leverage</b><br>
          <span>
                  Simplistically, operating leverage is determined by the operating income relative to changes in revenue. The analyst will calculate the impact on sensitivity on gross margins and variable costs to determine operating leverage. The analyst will take into account the ability of the company to cut fixed and variable costs in a challenged revenue environment and technological changes that may impact operating expenses. In addition, the analyst is to assess corporate strategies that include capital investment, which may be required for sustainable revenue growth, marketing expenses, and the company's ability to attract and retain talent and/or employees. The analyst should focus on the revenue opportunity and determine the price elasticity of demand for the company's products or services. In other words, the analyst is to rank the company based on improved operating margins going forward on an absolute and relative basis.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
                  High rank example: A company that has improving margins for the foreseeable future, with significant price elasticity. <br>
                  Low rank example: A company that is in a challenged revenue environment with a fixed cost structure and limited ability to cut costs, indicating an outlook for declining margins.
          </span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Financial Leverage</b><br/>
          <span>
                  A strict definition of financial leverage is total debt divided by total shareholder's equity. Financial leverage analysis is to determine the company's ability to improve shareholder value by means of utilizing its balance sheet to grow organically or to acquire assets. Analysts may look at the company's debt to cash flow leverage ratio, interest coverage ratios, or debt to equity ratios. In addition, the interest rate environment and the outlook for interest rates are a factor in determining the company's ability to manage financial leverage. Finally, the analyst is expected to determine the ability to service the debt given the industry and/or company profile, such as cyclicality, barriers to entry, history of bankruptcy, consistency in revenue and profit growth, or predictability in sales and profits and large cash reserves. The analyst is expected to take into account capital intensity of the company and the anticipated of capital allocation decisions.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            High rank example: A company with predictable and growing revenue and cash flow with modest debt levels. This may indicate that the company could improve shareholder value through growth investments, including acquisitions, using debt financing. <br>
                Low rank example: A company in a cyclical industry in a late stage economic cycle that has above average debt leverage and is in an industry that has a history of financial challenges, including bankruptcies.
