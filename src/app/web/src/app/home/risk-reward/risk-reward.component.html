        Risk is simply the measurable possibility of either losing value or not gaining value. In investment terms, risk is the uncertainty that an investment will deliver its expected return. In other words, risk involves the chance an investmentâ€™s actual return will differ from the expected return. Risk includes the possibility of losing some or all of the original investment. Different versions of risk are usually measured by calculating the standard deviation of the historical returns or average returns of a specific investment.

        A high standard deviation indicates a high degree of risk. Many companies allocate large amounts of money and time in developing risk management strategies to help manage risks associated with their business and investment dealings. A key component of the risk management process is risk assessment, which involves the determination of the risks surrounding a business or investment.

        A fundamental idea in finance is the relationship between risk and return. The greater the amount of risk an investor is willing to take, the greater the potential return. Investors need to be compensated for taking on additional risk. For example, a U.S. Treasury bond is considered one of the safest investments and when compared to a corporate bond, provides a lower rate of return. A corporation is much more likely to go bankrupt than the U.S. government. Because the risk of investing in a corporate bond is higher, investors are offered a higher rate of return.

        Micro-caps, which are featured on Channelchek, often have limited liquidity. Lack of regular analyst coverage and institutional buying are reasons why there is less liquidity in the micro-cap markets than in larger-cap stocks.

        Overall, micro-cap stocks represent a high-risk, potential high-reward opportunity for investors who are willing to do more research on the company involved, to determine whether it is worth the investment.
